Web-based Desktop Client for [Mastodon][]
=========================================
[![npm version][npm version badge]][npm]

Mstdn is a desktop application based on the mobile version of the Mastodon page
and the [Electron][] framework. It basically uses Mastodon's mobile page and
provides various desktop application features (such as desktop notifications,
keybindings, and multi-account support).

<img src="https://github.com/rhysd/ss/blob/master/Mstdn/main.png?raw=true" width="484" alt="screen shot"/>

Features:

- [x] Small window on your menubar (or isolated normal window)
- [x] Desktop notification
- [x] Customizable (and pluggable) shortcut keybinds
- [x] Multi-account (switching among accounts)
- [x] User CSS
- [x] Plugin architecture based on Node.js and Electron APIs

Mastodon is an open source project. So if you want to make a new UI, you can
just fork the project, implement your favorite UI and host it on your place.
Then you can participate Mastodon networks from it.

However, Mastodon is a web application. So we can't use it outside of a browser.
This small tool provides the ability to use the Mastodon page in a desktop
application window outside of a browser.

## Installation

### Via [npm][]

```
$ npm install -g mstdn
```

### Via [yarn][]

```
$ yarn global add mstdn --prefix /usr/local
```

### As an isolated app

Download a package archive from the [Release page][], put the unarchived app
into the proper place, and open it.

### Arch Linux ([AUR][])

Install the `mstdn` package from the AUR.

## Usage

If you installed this app via npm or yarn, the following command is available to
start app:

```
$ open-mstdn-app
```

At first, a dialog which recommends that you create a config is shown and JSON
config file will be opened in your editor. You need to fill in the `"name"` and
`"host"` keys in first element of `"accounts"`. Please see the `accounts`
section below for more information about how to configure the option.

Then please try to start app again. Usage is the same as web client on mobile
devices. Some shortcuts are available by default (please see the 'Customization'
section below).

Supported platforms are macOS (confirmed with 10.12), Linux (confirmed on Arch
Linux kernel version 4.11) and Windows (confirmed with Windows 8.1).

There are two window modes in this app: 'menubar mode' and 'normal window mode'.
You can switch them with `"normal_window"` option (please see below
'Customization' section for how to configure it).

- **menubar mode**: Window is attached to the menubar. You can toggle the window
  by clicking the menubar icon or typing the hot key. The advantage of this mode
  is that the app does not fill any workspaces. You can see your timeline on
  demand anytime. Like as menus in menubar on macOS, menubar window is automatically
  hidden when it loses its focus. This mode is the default on macOS and Linux.
- **normal window mode**: App starts with a normal window like a separated
  browser window. You can put/resize window wherever you would like in your
  workspace.

In both modes, the app remembers the size and location of its window. So you
need to specify window size (or location in normal window mode) only once.

After starting the app, you would see the login page of your instance. Some
instances allow to login with other web services. However, Mstdn.app cannot
fully support it. If you encounter problems with a customized login feature,
please try to login with normal flow instead.

## Customization

Mstdn can be customized using the JSON config file at `{app dir}/config.json`

The `{app dir}` is:

- `~/Library/Application\ Support/Mstdn` for macOS
- `~/.config/Mstdn` for Linux
- `%APPDATA%\Mstdn` for Windows.

The JSON file can contain the following key-values:

### `hot_key`

`hot_key` is a key sequence to toggle application window. The shortcut key is
defined globally.  The format is an [Electron's
accelerator](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/accelerator.md).
Please see the document to know how to configure this value. Default value is
`"CmdOrCtrl+Shift+Enter"`. If you want to disable, please set this value to an
empty string or `null`.

### `icon_color`

The color of icon in menubar. `"black"` or `"white"` can be specified.

### `always_on_top`

When this value is set to `true`, the window won't be hidden if it loses a
focus. Default value is `false`.

### `normal_window`

When this value is set to `true`, application will be launched as a normal
window application.  If the menu bar behavior does not work for you, please set
this value to `true` to avoid it.  Default value is `false` on macOS or Linux,
`true` on Windows because window position is broken in some versions of Windows.

### `show_dock_icon`

If you are on macOS, you can use this option to hide the icon from your Dock. This
prevents the window from showing up in the application switcher (âŒ˜+TAB) menu. Useful
if you keep accidentally switching to it after you close the menu.

### `hide_menu`

When this value is set to `true`, the application will be launched with the
menubar hidden, assuming `normal_window` is also true. When set to `false`, the
menubar will be visible on launch. Default value is `false`.

On Windows, typing Alt key shows the hidden menubar.

### `zoom_factor`

Font zoom factor in application. It should be positive number. For example,
`0.7` means `70%` font zooming. Default font size is a bit bigger because the UI
is originally for mobile devices. So default value is `0.9`.

### `accounts`

Array of your accounts. Each element should have `"name"`, `"host"` and
`"default_page"` keys.

- `"name"` represents your screen name. If your name is `@foo` then please
  specify `"foo"` for it.

- `"host"` represents a host part of URL of your mastodon instance. If you
  belong to `https://mastodon.social`, please specify `mastodon.social`.
  `https://` is not necessary.

- `"default_page"` is a path of the first shown page on app start. If
  `/web/notifications` is specified, `https://{your host}/web/notifications`
  will be opened when the app starts.

You need to write up this config at first.

### `chromium_sandbox`

If `true` is specified, Chromium's native sandbox is enabled (and default value
is `true`).  Sandbox provides some OS level security protection such as resource
access control like tabs in Chromium. However, sandbox also blocks plugins for
Electron application.

If `false` is specified, you can use some advanced features (user CSS and key
shortcut plugin).  Before setting `false` to this value, please read and
understand [sandbox documentation in Electron repo][sandbox doc] to know what
you're doing.

Please note that this sandbox feature is different from Node.js integration in
Electron. Node.js integration is always disabled.

### `keymaps`

Object whose key is a key sequence and whose value is an action name.

| Action Name       | Description                     | Default Key |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| `scroll-down`     | Scroll down window              | `j`         |
| `scroll-up`       | Scroll up window                | `k`         |
| `scroll-top`      | Scroll up to top of window      | `i`         |
| `scroll-bottom`   | Scroll down to bottom of window | `m`         |
| `next-account`    | Switch to next account          | N/A         |
| `prev-account`    | Switch to previous account      | N/A         |
| `open-in-browser` | Open current page in browser    | N/A         |

If an action name starts with `/`, it will navigate to the path. For example,
if you set `"/web/timelines/home"` to some key shortcut and you input the key,
browser will navigate page to `https://{your host}/web/timelines/home`.

Below is a default path actions. They are corresponding the position of tab
items.

| Path                          | Description                       | Default Key |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| `/web/statuses/new`           | Move to 'make a new toot' page    | `1`         |
| `/web/timelines/home`         | Move to 'home timeline' page      | `2`         |
| `/web/notifications`          | Move to 'notifications' page      | `3`         |
| `/web/timelines/public/local` | Move to 'local timeline' page     | `4`         |
| `/web/timelines/public`       | Move to 'federated timeline' page | `5`         |
| `/web/getting-started`        | Move to 'getting started' page    | `6`         |

If an action name ends with `.js`, it will run key shortcut plugin (please see
below 'Key Shortcut Plugin' section). This plugin feature requires
`"chromium_sandbox": true`.

By default, some key shortcuts for tab items are set in addition to above table.

  }
}
</code></pre>
</details>

## Multi account

If you add multiple accounts to the `accounts` array in `config.json`, an
`Accounts` menu item will appear in the application menu.

![multi account menu item](https://github.com/rhysd/ss/blob/master/Mstdn/multi-account.png?raw=true)

It will show the list of your accounts. The check mark indicates the current
user. When you click menu item of non-current user, application window will be
recreated and switch page to the account.

## Key Shortcut Plugin

By specifying JavaScript file to action name in `keymaps` of `config.json`, you
can write your favorite behavior with JavaScript directly. Please note that
`"chromium_sandbox" : true` is also required (if you don't know what happens
with `"chromium_sandbox" : true`, please read the above config section).

```json
{
    ...

    "chromium_sandbox": false,

    ...

    "keymaps": {
        "r": "hello.js"
    }
}
```

The script file path is a relative path from your `Mstdn` application directory.
For example, Specifying `hello.js` will run `/Users/You/Application
Support/Mstdn/hello.js` on Mac.

The plugin script MUST export one function. The function receives a
configuration object and the current account object as its parameters. So the
above `hello.js` would look like:

```js
module.exports = function (config, account) {
    alert('Hello, ' + account.name);
}
```

With above example config, typing `r` will show 'Hello, {your name}' alert
dialog. You can use any DOM APIs, Node.js's standard libraries and Electron APIs
in a plugin script.

## User CSS

When `user.css` is put in your `Mstdn` application directory, it will be loaded
automatically.  To enable this feature, `"chromium_sandbox" : true` is also
required (if you don't know what happens with `"chromium_sandbox" : true`,
please read the above config section).

For example, the below `/Users/You/Application Support/Mstdn/user.css` will
change font color to red on Mac.

```css
body {
  color: red !important;
}
```

## Plugin (experimental)

You can make a Node.js package which is run inner mastodon page.

Plugin is enabled if `chromium_sandbox` option is set to `false`. Please read
above configuration section before using any plugin.

### How to make a plugin

Create a `node_modules` directory in your application directory at first. And
then, please make `mstdn-plugin-hello` directory. It consists a node package.

The package name must start with `mastdn-plugin-`.

Make `package.json` manually or by `$ npm init` in the directory.

```json
{
  "name": "mstdn-plugin-hello",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Sample plugin of Mstdn.app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Your name",
  "license": "Some license"
}
```

And make `index.js` as below:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    preload(config, account) {
        console.log('Hello from plugin!', config, account);
    }
};
```

Each package must export one object. If the object has a function as a value of
`preload` key, it will be called when the page is being loaded. The function
receives two parameters `config` and `account`.

By defining `keymaps` key you can define plugin-defined key shortcut action.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    preload(config, account) {
        console.log('Hello from plugin!', config, account);
    },
    keymaps: {
        'alert-hello'(event, config, account) {
            event.preventDefault();
            alert('Hello, ' + account.name);
        }
    }
};
```

The `keymaps` object has keymap action name (key) and its handler (value).
Here 'alert-hello' key shortcut action is defined. Key shortcut handler takes 3
arguments. `config` and `account` is the same as `preload`'s. `event` is a
`KeyboardEvent` browser event on the key shortcut being called. You can cancel
default event behavior using the `.preventDefault()` method.

User can specify the key shortcut as `plugin:{plugin name}:{action name}`. In
above example, `plugin:hello:alert-hello` is available in `keymaps` section in
config.json.

Note that you can use below APIs in the script.

- [Node.js standard libraries][] via `require` (e.g. `require('fs')`)
- Dependant node packages listed in `package.json` of the plugin
- [Electron Renderer APIs][Electron APIs]
- All Web APIs on browser (including DOM API)

#### !!! Security Notice !!!

Do not leak Node.js stuff to global namespace like below.

```javascript
// Never do things like this!
window.my_require = require;
```

### How to use

If you didn't try above 'How to make' section, please install plugin package at
first.  Below will install 'hello' plugin to `{app
directory}/node_modules/mstdn-plugin-hello`.

```
$ cd {Your application directory}
$ npm install mstdn-plugin-hello
```

And then write what plugin should be loaded to `"plugins"` section of your
account in `config.json`. `"hello"` should be added to the list. If listed
plugin defines some keymaps, you can specify it in `keymaps` section with
`plugin:{name}:{action}` format.

```json
{
    ...

    "accounts": [
        {
            ...

            "plugins": [
                "hello"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "keymaps": {
        ...

        "ctrl+h": "plugin:hello:alert-hello"
    },

    ...
}
```

Note that you can enable different plugin for each your accounts.

Finally open Mstdn.app and open the DevTools via [Menu] -> [View] -> [Developper
Tools] -> console. If window is too small to see DevTools, please make window
size bigger.

In the developer console, the message 'Hello from plugin!', config information
and account information should be output.

### List of Plugins

To be made

## How to Debug

By setting `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development`, Mstdn will start in
debug mode.

In debug mode, app outputs all logs to stdout and opens DevTools for a page
rendered in a window automatically. You can also see logs in 'console' tab of
DevTools for debugging renderer process.

```sh
# If you installed this app via npm or yarn
$ NODE_ENV=development open-mstdn-app

# Package on macOS
$ NODE_ENV=development /path/to/Mstdn.app/Contents/MacOS/Mstdn

# Package on Linux
$ NODE_ENV=development /path/to/Mstdn-linux-xxx-x.y.z/Mstdn

# Package on cmd.exe on Windows
$ set NODE_ENV=development
$ \path\to\Mstdn-win32-xxx-x.y.z\Mstdn.exe
```
